# Overview

As a software engineer, I developed a web application for event booking and registration using Django. This project aims to enhance my skills in web development using Python and Django framework, particularly focusing on database modeling, user authentication, form handling, and views management.

The web app allows users to view a list of events, see event details, and register for events they are interested in attending. It includes user authentication to track event registrations per user.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

1. Event Listing Page: Displays a list of available events with basic details such as title, date, time, and location. Users can click on individual events to view more details.

2. Event Detail Page: Shows detailed information about a specific event, including description and capacity. Users can register for the event on this page.
# Development Environment

I used the following tools to develop the software:

* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.10
* Django 3.2
* SQLite database for development

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

There are several areas for future improvement and additions to the project:

* Add email notifications for event registration and updates.
* Enhance the front-end with better styling and interactivity using JavaScript frameworks like React.
